//! Inbox shard contract (ADR-0001, Phase 3).
//!
//! One contract **per user**, parameterized by the owner's ML-DSA-65 verifying
//! key bytes (`parameters = owner_vk_bytes`, exactly like the user shard), so the
//! contract key is `blake3(inbox_shard_wasm || owner_vk)` — distinct per user and
//! distinct from that user's user shard because the WASM hash differs (ADR-0001 →
//! "Shard key derivation").
//!
//! ## Write authority — anyone-writes notifications, owner-prunes
//!
//! The inbox is **anyone-writes** for *delivery*: any party may append a
//! [`Notification`] (a reply / mention / follow / quote targeting the owner).
//! Each notification **self-verifies** — it is signed by its *sender* and bound
//! to the owner's VK (the recipient), so it cannot be replayed into another
//! user's inbox. Who may be a sender is the abuse question ADR-0001 leaves to a
//! credential mechanism (GhostKey is the candidate); the [`WriterCert`] wire slot
//! is reserved and checked by [`verify_writer_cert`], which accepts everything
//! today.
//!
//! Only the **owner** may *prune*. A prune is an owner-signed
//! [`SignedOp`](freenet_microblogging_common::signed_op::SignedOp) bound to
//! [`INBOX_SHARD_CONTEXT`], in two forms:
//! * `OpType::PruneIds` — drop the explicit notification ids in the payload
//!   (selective: kill one spam notification).
//! * `OpType::PruneBefore` — advance a monotonic high-water `pruned_before` to
//!   `op.seq`, dropping every notification whose own `seq` is below it (bulk:
//!   "clear everything older than N").
//!
//! ## Convergence (every rule order-independent — AGENTS.md → "Contract
//! correctness invariants")
//!
//! The hard part of an owner-prune on an anyone-writes surface is that a *stale
//! replica* still holding a pruned notification must not **resurrect** it when it
//! merges with a pruned replica. So a prune leaves durable, convergent evidence —
//! but because *removal is the owner's exclusive right*, that evidence must itself
//! carry the owner's signature on **every** path, exactly like a notification
//! carries its sender's. State therefore retains the **owner-signed prune ops**,
//! not a sig-stripped projection of their effect:
//!
//! * **`prune_before_op`** — the single highest-`seq` owner-signed `PruneBefore`
//!   op. The high-water is that op's `seq`; because `seq` is inside the signed
//!   payload, a peer cannot forge `pruned_before = u64::MAX` without the owner
//!   key. Merged by keeping the higher-`seq` *verified* op.
//! * **`prune_ids_ops`** — owner-signed `PruneIds` ops (keyed by op `seq`), each
//!   naming the ids it prunes. A tombstone for `id` exists only while backed by
//!   such a verified op. Merged as a verified-op union.
//! * **`notifs`** — a grow-set keyed by content-addressed id, admitted only if it
//!   self-verifies, is **not** tombstoned, and is **not** below the high-water.
//!
//! Selective tombstones are a **pure grow-set**, bounded only by the
//! `MAX_PRUNE_IDS_OPS` backstop. An earlier draft tried to GC a tombstone once an
//! owner-attested per-id `notif_seq` fell below the high-water, but that seq was
//! never tied to the notif's real seq — an understated value let GC drop a live
//! tombstone and resurrect the notif (review MAJOR, seventh round). There is no
//! sound high-water GC for a bare id, so the bulk-cleanup tool is `PruneBefore`
//! (a single max-wins op needing no GC); selective `PruneIds` accumulate until
//! the rare backstop eviction (best-effort lossy, like the notif window).
//!
//! **Every prune op is re-verified against the owner on *every* path** (delta,
//! full-state merge, sync delta) before it can raise the high-water or add a
//! tombstone — there is no "the peer already pruned it" shortcut, because trusting
//! an unsigned removal claim lets any peer wipe an honest inbox network-wide
//! (`max`-wins never heals — review CRITICAL, sixth round). `validate_state`
//! re-proves every retained prune op *and* every stored notification, and rejects
//! a notification that the retained prune state should have removed — the same
//! "every write path verifies, the two halves agree" discipline as the thread
//! shard (AGENTS.md → "Every write path verifies").
