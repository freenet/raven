//! Shared facade contract types.
//!
//! Issue #45. Lives in its own crate (outside the freenet-microblogging
//! workspace) so the on-chain facade contract's wasm bytes don't shift every
//! time something unrelated in the workspace lockfile moves.
//!
//! Consumers:
//!  * `freenet-microblogging-facade` (the on-chain contract, also outside the
//!    workspace) — depends on this crate by path.
//!  * the signer / integration tests — depend by path too, so the import
//!    surface stays stable.
