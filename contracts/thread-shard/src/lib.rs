//! Thread shard contract (ADR-0001, Phase 2).
//!
//! One contract **per root post**, created lazily on the first reply, and
//! **anyone-writes**: it collects the replies, likes, and quote references that
//! target one root post. The contract is parameterized by the root post's
//! content-addressed id (`parameters = root_post_id` bytes), so the contract key
//! is `blake3(thread_shard_wasm || root_post_id)` — distinct per thread, and
//! distinct from a user shard with the same parameters because the WASM hash
//! differs (ADR-0001 → "Shard key derivation").
//!
//! ## Write authority (anyone-writes)
//!
//! Unlike the owner-writes user shard, a thread shard accepts writes from any
//! party. Each entry still **self-verifies** — a reply is a self-signed
//! [`Post`](freenet_microblogging_common::post::Post) whose `reply_to` equals
//! this thread's root; a like / quote is a signed
//! [`LikeRecord`] / [`QuoteRef`] bound to the root id. Verification proves *who*
//! signed, not that the signer is *allowed*. Constraining who may write is the
//! abuse question ADR-0001 leaves to a credential mechanism (GhostKey is the
//! candidate); the [`WriterCert`] wire slot is reserved and checked by the
//! [`verify_writer_cert`] seam, which accepts everything today.
//!
//! ## Convergence (every rule order-independent — AGENTS.md → "Contract
//! correctness invariants")
//!
//! * **replies** — grow-set deduped by content-address id, truncated post-merge
//!   to the newest `MAX_REPLIES` by `(timestamp, id)` desc (a total order; no
//!   clock in a contract).
//! * **likes** — per-liker join semilattice: keep the higher `seq` per liker,
//!   and on equal `seq` an **unlike wins** (deterministic tie-break, mirroring
//!   the user-shard follow rule). Capped post-merge by `truncate_likes`
//!   (tombstones first, then a total order over keys).
//! * **quotes** — grow-set deduped by `quote_post_id`, capped post-merge.
//!
//! `validate_state` checks authority + self-verification + thread-binding + no
//! duplicates, but deliberately does **not** enforce the caps: a transiently
//! over-bound merged state is normal, and rejecting it would break convergence.
